    // this class contains the "Landscape" and "Features" that shape the mood of the overall story and therefore the song themes 
    // books are composed of Plots (Compostion/Phrases) Characters (Themes) and Places/Locations/Stages/Sets which as shown all form the building
    // blocks of most songs as well. The over interaction of all of those "elements" (plots, characters, locations, etc) weave character plot interaction
    // plot to plot interactions and other "themematic" elements that might be further rendered as a "Heroic Character" "Villian" and might be steeped in
    // tragic, heroic, and other various arch-types that are reflective of human nature... in music its various respective elements (melody, theme, harmonic, trasitional, etc 
    // are done through chord progressions and the light and can allow what we are creating here to hopefully assume those same inteactions between story 
    // elements and notes, chords, and beats
    // One of the sub elements this class contains will have a map of all of the final word lists that will serve as our pool of items that will hopefully comprise 
    // the storys characters, places, and maybe even element... each of which should result in a arpeggio or chord comprised of the array of letters in each 
    // of those elements... we will then "map" each of those letters that contrive this list of words that will hopefully reflect the stoy we are rendering to 
    // music/song to our set of chord progressions in a relative "map" musical note shaped by that progression...
